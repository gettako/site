# Contributing to Takoterm Site

First off, thank you for considering contributing to Takoterm! We value your time and effort.

## 📁 Project Architecture & The `content` Submodule

This repository (`gettako/site`) handles the web framework and UI (Nuxt & Docus). However, the actual documentation markdown files live in a separate repository (`gettako/docs`) which is included here as a Git Submodule in the `content/` folder.

### How to Edit Documentation

1. Make your changes inside the `content/` directory.
2. Commit and push those changes from **inside** the `content/` directory (this updates the `gettako/docs` repo).
3. Go back to the root of `gettako/site`, commit the updated submodule reference, and push it.

*See [AGENTS.md](./AGENTS.md) for more technical details on handling the submodule.*

## 📝 Conventional Commits Guide

We follow the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) specification for our commit messages. This leads to more readable messages that are easy to follow when looking through the project history, and helps automate release notes.
